# What is hummingbird?

TL;DR: `hummingbird` is the fastest way to create an (opinionated) kubernetes cluster with a tools and services which we love and use at [sahaj](https://github.com/sahajsoft/hummingbird-doc) ðŸ˜„.

We work with a variety of clients. A non-trivial amount of time is spent setting up the infrastructure and shaping it up to a level that we like. It is also true that across projects, we make use of similar set of services (mostly open-source ðŸ˜„) to make our lives easier. Project `hummingbird` is aimed at automating this repetitive task.

Hummingbird therefore achieves the following:

* reduce dev time required to set up infra
* standardise the set of tools and services we use across clients, so we are assured that the infra is robust and follows good practises
* prefer convention over configuration so that we can get up and running as soon as possible, while leaving the infra configurable for changes.

## How does `hummingbird` plan to achieve this?

For starters, we are assuming that we deploy into a containerised environment. Deploying into non-containerized environment is a feature that we are not exploring for now (although we have considered it). 

There are few challenges in standardising infra and automating this task

* we cannot be sure if we want to create a cluster and deploy our services or re-use an existing cluster given to us by the client.
* the control plane can change at any given time. For instance client may change cloud provider, or move from managed to self-managed service.
* Some services which we want to deploy are not wanted in the project or may already exist in the project.

`hummingbird` is designed keeping all of this in mind. Read about how [here](../Architecture)
